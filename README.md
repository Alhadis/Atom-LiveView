Atom Live View
==============

Base class for implementing a live previewer which renders files asynchronously as they're edited.
Much of its functionality was distilled from Atom's [`markdown-preview`](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview) package.

Currently a work-in-progress, but will eventually power
[`postscript-preview`](https://github.com/Alhadis/Atom-PostScriptPreview) and
[`language-roff`](https://github.com/Alhadis/language-roff)'s preview windows.
